People want to use computers to make more money. For lots of reasons this is hard. People pay people like me lots of money to build and fix the computers, but this is still pretty hard and takes a lot of time. I write computer words that tell the computers how to build and fix themselves. I also write words about the computers that explain the computers to humans. This makes it easier to keep the computers working and lets us work more on new ways to use computers to help people make money.
