title: End of Development for DnD Sheets Webapp
categories: programming
---

In response to Wizard of The Coast's takedown of [Ed Friedlander's DnD character generators](http://www.pathguy.com/ddnext.htm), I am stopping development of [my own DnD character sheet manager](https://www.github.com/dharmab/sheets).

While I do not believe that my work violates any WoTC copyrights or trademarks, I am not comfortable taking on the risk of further developing and deploying DnD-related software in light of these recent events. I will likely fork the non-DnD components of the Sheets app for use in other applications.

I understand WoTC's position in this issue but I am disappointed with their current course. I hope that they reconsider and change their approach to community-created software in the future.
