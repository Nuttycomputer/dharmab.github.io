These are some Sublime Text 3 plugins I like. You can install them with [Package Control](http://sublime.wbond.net).

*Updated 2014-10-01*

### Languages

* [SQF](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SQF%20Language) - Scripting language used in the Arma games
* [INI](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/INI) - INI files and systemd service units
* [CMake](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/CMake) - CMake build system

###[amCoder](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Theme%20-%20amCoder)

A nice theme to match Monokai. Previously, I used [Soda](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Theme%20-%20Soda).

###[Emmet](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet)

A must-have shortcuts system for web programming.

###[LaTeXTools](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/LaTeXTools)

Pretty nice LaTeX plugin that I use side-by-side with Evince.

###[Markdown Preview](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Markdown%20Preview)

A handy tool for checking my Markdown syntax when I write READMEs or this blog.

###[Git](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Git)

Normally I use Git from the shell, but this is handy for quickly adding a file.

###[GitGutter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GitGutter)

Having a quick indicator of which lines changed is essential for code review.

###[AlignTab](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/AlignTab)

Makes formatting source code easy.

###[Trimmer](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Trimmer)

Cleans up extra trailing spaces.

###[Sublime SFTP](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp) (Commercial)

I don't use this very often, but I've had a few classes where we were required to use the school's webserver with very limited permissions and editors available. I used Sublime SFTP to use my local copy of Sublime to edit files remotely. If I have control of my environment, I prefer to use [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) to manage development environments and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to configure the development and production environments.
